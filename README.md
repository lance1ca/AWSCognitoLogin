# AWSCognitoLogin
This is a custom NodeJS App using the amazon-cognito-identity-js npm package to manually implement AWS Cognito. This web app features usage of AWS Cognito's features such as registering a user, verifying a user email (limited attempts per code, you can resend a code, etc.), logging in (brings you to a dashboard), and signing out. All of these features have security coverage and protocol and also have been tested. This current version functions well and works as intended. This is still a work in progress, so there are more features, comments, options, and styling to come soon.
